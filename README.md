## Description
The possibilities to involve small-scale prosumers for ancillary services in the distribution grid through aggregators and local flexibility markets, question whether it is profitable for prosumers to oversize proactively. In this analysis, a Python model is developed to identify the cost optimal operation plan of the PV-battery system and to evaluate the device flexibility. An economic assessment is carried out to derive the cost-benefit of sizing based on the mean electricity price. A sensitivity analysis is performed with the above results to study the profitable sizing of PV-battery systems with flexibility services. The results show promising advantage of oversizing although limitations prevail with the extent of flexibility services offered.
